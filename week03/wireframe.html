            <p1>Arcane is a serie about the videogame League Of Legends, but at the difference of a lot of series like this you dont need to know things about the videogame for watch it and understand, even my mom that dont play videogames loves the serie a lot. The history, characters and plot are so well used. A lot of times I was at the edge of the chair watching Arcane, with action scenes, characters past, and with hearthbreaking moments. I love Arcane</p1>
